After a quick search I found this in their [Help](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/2016.3/comparing-folders.html):

> You can also open the difference viewer without running PhpStorm. This is done through the following command:
> 
> ```
> <path to PhpStorm executable file> diff <path_1> <path_2>
> ```
> 
> where `path_1` and `path_2` are paths to the folders in question. 

Just what the doctor ordered! I immediately set up a button in my file manager and I was happy as I could be.
