I appreciate every tool that makes it easier working on a website. Browser extensions are one of these and they often save a lot of time. I won't list some well-known ones here, just a few with often specific purposes.

## JavaScript Errors Notifier

> _Notifies JavaScript errors by icon in toolbar bar or notification popup_

I use (see) this one the very often, unfortunately :) It's an outstandingly handy extension because puts a red icon to the bottom-right corner of the page if a JavaScript error occurs. This way you know at once that there's something to fix. No more clicking around in vain to find out why the page is not working.

## Copytables

> _Chrome extension to select and copy table cells._

As its description says, it allows copying table cells, among other things. Just hold down ctrl and/or alt and click to select cells or columns. After making a selection, you can copy values (in different formats), but there's even more: you can see some stats as well. For example, the count of cells, the average, sum, etc. I didn't pay too much attention to this feature but a few times I really appreciated it as I could easily check various data, without opening a calculator.

## Utime

> _Converts UNIX timestamps to human-readable dates and vice versa._

This was a real lifesaver for me when I worked on a timesheet application. I could easily check a timestamp's human readable value, which would have been otherwise very cumbersome. But you can also modify the value, whether the timestamp or the rendered datetime string. Sometimes I needed to adjust timestamps in the database via PhpMyAdmin, and using Utime it was a breeze.

## JSON Viewer Awesome

> _This extension assist you to visualize JSON response from any website or API request in your browser._

This extension comes very handy when I'm working with JSON data, eg. with APIs. Automatically beautifies JSON but has an input area where you can enter your custom JSON. A very nice feature of it is the "Graph" view mode that beautifully shows the hierarchy.

## XV — XML Viewer

> _Powerful XML viewer for Google Chrome_

Just like JSON, XML is another type of document that is easier to understand visually (at least for me). This extension does a great job in visualizing data, and shows an outline of the document as well. You can search nodes by name or xpath, which is a big plus.

Note: allow the extension to access file urls, so you can drag-and-drop an xml to the browser and use the extension.

## CSS Used

> _Get all css rules used by the selected DOM and its children._

Sometimes I need to get all the CSS styles for a given element, eg. duplicate the appearance in a static HTML document. I've tried a few extensions but this one worked the best.

## +1: Dark Reader

> _Dark mode for every website. Take care of your eyes, use dark theme for night and daily browsing._

It's a popular extension and while actually I prefer the original authored site colors, it's fun to see  sites in dark mode. At work I noticed some colleagues using this extension so I went ahead and corrected some color issues on some of our internal sites. Most of the time the dark mode looks just fine, but it's not a bad idea to check the site you are currently working on in dark mode.

## +2: SimpleExtManager

> _A simple menu to enable, disable and access options of extensions._

Allows managing extensions in a user-friendly way, recommended if you have more than a dozen of them.

## That's all
