## Who is it for?

The first step is to identify your target audience. Once you got it, you will clearly see what to cook and how to serve.

## Less === More

Make the design as simple as possible and keep texts at bare minimum. It’s a win-win situation: readers will appreciate the cleaner concept and it will be easier for you to develop/update.

## Pick your favorites

You surely want to showcase your best works only. Doing so you may leave out projects that are not top-notch but do excel in some areas. Bear in mind that no project is perfect - emphasize the part you enjoyed the most.

## Have your say

Do not keep visitors in doubt, attach at least a few words to the projects. This is where you can add an extra personal touch so don’t miss the chance.

## Enhance

Enhance your site from time to time progressively. There is always something to improve. Remember that even Rome wasn’t built in a day.

So my answer is: yes, it is fun - but can be a nuisance if taken too seriously.
